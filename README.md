# PyOverheadGame

This is a successor of the game [Robot 2](https://github.com/albertz/Robot2)
and [Robot](http://www.az2000.de/projects/robot/)
which are itself pretty much very simplistic variants of [The game of ROBOT](http://www.game-of-robot.de/).
I changed the name in this project to avoid confusion.

It is a game played with 2D top-down perspective (thus "overhead")
where you play a single character and go through several rooms.
You can select and use several items.
You need to get keys to be able to pass corresponding doors.
There are enemies (robots) which you have to avoid and
which you need to destroy indirectly.

The game is mostly for educational purpose
for simple Python 3 code with the [Python Arcade library](https://pythonhosted.org/arcade/).
